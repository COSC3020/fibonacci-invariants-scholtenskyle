# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

I made sure that certain indexes would be defined with the proper values if needed. The amount of these given values changes depending on the input into the function. Also, some of these variiables will remain undefined until after the final recursive call (this would be the invariant). This is true as there is always some amount of undefined variables throughout the code, until the array is slowly filled with actually defined values. But making sure that some are defined at the beginning allows for the rest of the calculations to be done properly with a good starting point. ChatGPT did help with some of this reasoning, as well as the ideas of slowly filling in the array.

The Invariant is as follows: At least one element within the array will be undefined until after the final recursive call.
